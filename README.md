Bloat-free toolbox to create and operate new blockchains based on ethereum technology using [geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/). Fabchain is fully cross-platform and facilitates operations on nodes using the command-line: one can use it to compile and deploy smart contracts as well easily build public web interfaces to contract operations using [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org).

Fabchain is optimized to run with bare-bone ethereum tools:
- there is no javascript or nodejs involved
- runs everywhere inside a minimal Alpine GNU/Linux docker
- geth is natively compiled from its golang source
- solc is natively compiled from its C++ source
- interaction is designed via shell scripts and makefiles
- deployement is orchestrated using ansible and makefiles
- everything can be scripted and operated non-interactively

## üíæ Install

This application is made to work on Apple/OSX, Microsoft/WSL or
GNU/Linux desktop systems. The host system needs the following
dependencies installed:

- Make, awk, bash, find, curl (found pretty much everywhere)
- Docker - http://docker.com (from website, don't use distro packages)
- upnpc - http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org (optional, to automatically open port forwarding)
- Python3, pip and web3 (optional, to extract private keys for other wallets)

## üéÆ Quick start

Fabchain is operated from a terminal inside its folder, all commands are
issued by the Makefile and therefore prefixed by `make`.

Starting fabchain will result in a JSON-RPC API interface available on localhost:8545.

To run your own fabchain node just clone this repo, enter its directory and:

1. Install Zenroom.org in your path
2. Generate the configuration using `make create-config`
3. Start the API node client using `make run`

It will start a light node connected to our testnet (Chain ID `fabt`).

To access the container running use `make shell`

To access the geth console running use `make console`.

To stop issue the command `make stop`.

A full overview of commands is shown simply typing `make`:

```
Server commands:
Usage:
  make <target>

General
  help             Display this help.

Server commands
  run              start the API node listening on HTTP port
  run-signer       start the SIGNER node networking on the P2P port
  status           see if server is running and print public addres
  logs             show the logs of the running server
  shell            open a shell inside running server (CMD=sh or custom)
  enr              Obtain the ENR node record (admin.nodeInfo.enr)
  console          open the geth console inside running server
  stop             stop running server

Network commands
  upnp-open        open UPNP port-forwarding on LAN router
  upnp-close       close UPNP port-forwarding on LAN router

Contract commands
  contract-deploy  deploy a web3 smart-contract in SOL=contracts/file.sol
  contract-info    obtain contract information about the TXID=hash

Account commands:
  account          create a new private account in data/keystore
  backup           print the private account content as JSON string
  backup-secret    print the wallet master secret key
  restore          ask for private account JSON to restore backup

Genesis commands
  genesis-create   Create data/genesis.json from scripts/params_genesis.json
  genesis-init     Initialize node to use the new chain in data/genesis.json

Development commands
  tag              compute the version tag for current build
  pull             pull the image from docker-hub online repo
  push             push the image to docker-hub online repo
  build            build the docker container
  debug            run a shell in a new interactive container (no daemons)
```

## üêù API

Fabchain uses the official ethereum go client to provide full access to
the latest API specifications for the namespaces `eth` and `web3`
available on nodes connecting port 8545 via HTTP.

API documentation is maintained by the ethereum project:
- [Latest Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/eth1.0-apis/assembled-spec/openrpc.json&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:splitView%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:input%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:examplesDropdown%5D=false)
- https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API (wiki documentation)
- https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-eth (main namespace)
- https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-clique (administration of permissioned chains)
- https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-miner (signing transactions)

## üåû GENESIS

This is something only people running a whole new blockchain based on
fabchain need to know, or system administrators of the fabchain and
its testnet.

To bootstrap a new blockchain one needs to create a genesis, which
needs a new chainID which is an integer, easy to find using a string
for instance `fabt` we do:
```
echo "print(BIG.new(O.from_string('fabt')):decimal())" | zenroom
```
And find `1717658228` as our 4 letter chain ID.

Then copy
[scripts/params-genesis.json.example](scripts/params-genesis.json.example)
to a new file `scripts/params-genesis.json` and configure it with the
chain IDs, the current epoch and other base configurations as for
instance the `share` of coins assigned to each signer, which is in
fact the total amount of coins pre-mined.

Then install all the new signer nodes, create their accounts and note
down their addressess, using our [devops](devops) setup that is simply
made with:

```
cd devops
make server-create    # creates 3 signers and 1 api server
make install          # instals all servers with fabchain
make create-accounts  # creates fabchain accounts
make list-addressess  # prints fabchain account addresses
cd -
```

Then fill the signer addressess in the `scripts/params-genesis.json`
and run `make genesis-create` and the genesis will be found in
`data/genesis.json` ready for your local node.

Then if using the [devops](devops) tools to create the nodes:

```
cp data/genesis.json devops/
cd devops
make init-genesis
make init-bootnodes
cd -
```

Both `genesis.json` and `bootnodes.csv` need to be uploaded on
each new node for the network to function.
